# Costco Receipt Dashboard - README

A client-side web application for visualizing, searching, and analyzing Costco digital receipt data (`.json`). This dashboard transforms raw JSON exports into a highly readable, interactive ledger with financial breakdowns, tax auditing, and spending analytics.

### 🚀 Current State (v0.5.2)

The project has evolved from a simple list viewer into a robust financial audit tool. It features a "Dual-Mode" rendering engine that switches between a **History View** (grouped by shopping trip) and a **Search View** (flat item list) for granular filtering.

### ✨ Key Features

#### 1. Advanced Data Parsing
* **Timezone Agnostic:** Custom date parsers strictly respect the local time printed on the receipt (avoiding browser timezone shifts).
* **Smart Tax Engine:**
    * Reads root receipt taxes for accurate totals.
    * Maps distinct tax codes (e.g., "H" for HST, "G" for GST) from the `subTaxes` object to individual line items.
    * **Taxable Basis Logic:** Distinguishes between **TPD** (Store Discounts, taxed on net) and **CPN** (Manufacturer Coupons, taxed on original price).
* **Unit Conversion:** Automatically detects weighted items (Meat/Deli/Produce) and calculates:
    * Imperial (lb) vs Metric (kg) based on `warehouseCountry`.
    * Effective Unit Price (visualizing cost-per-unit after discounts).

#### 2. User Interface & Experience
* **Drag & Drop Import:** Browser-based file ingestion (no server upload required) for security and speed.
* **Dual-Mode Visualization:**
    * **History Mode:** Groups items under "Receipt Headers" (Blue for Sales, Red for Refunds) showing date, warehouse, item count, and trip totals.
    * **Search Mode:** Flattens the hierarchy to show individual results with context metadata (Date/Warehouse) attached to the row.
* **Infinite Scroll / Lazy Loading:** Renders receipts in batches of 20 to maintain 60fps performance with large datasets (thousands of items).

#### 3. Item "Ledger" Layout (CSS Grid)
Individual item rows utilize a strict 4-column CSS Grid layout for perfect vertical alignment:
1.  **Item Info:** Description, Badge (Markdown/Refund), Item #.
2.  **Units:** Displays Qty or Weight (with strike-through logic for discounted unit prices).
3.  **Price Math:** Visually stacks `Original Price`, `Saved Badge`, and `Net Price`.
4.  **Finals:** Visually stacks `Tax Details` (calculated rate + amount) and `Final Cost`.

#### 4. Filtering & Search
* **Interactive Badges:** Filter by **Refunds**, **Markdowns** (items ending in .97), and **Discounts**.
* **Contextual Date Picker:** Dynamically populated dropdown containing only dates present in the dataset.
* **Fuzzy Search:** Instant filtering by Item Description, Warehouse Name, or Item Number.

### 🛠 Technical Stack
* **Core:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Styling:** Bootstrap 5.3 + Custom CSS Grid/Flexbox.
* **Visualization:** Chart.js for "Top Spending" analytics.
* **Localization:** `Intl.NumberFormat` for dynamic currency handling (USD/CAD) based on receipt origin.
